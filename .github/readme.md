# Digression

__Make Scala stack traces more understandable__

Stack traces correspond to the classes, interfaces and methods as they exist on
the running JVM. The Scala definitions from which they originate may have
undergone various name changes during compilation, and features of Scala which
do not exist in Java may have been encoded in method and class names, such that
the original Scala names and features are harder to discern. _Digression_
believes that a Scala developer (particularly a beginner, who will still be
exposed to stack traces) should not have to understand how Scala is encoded in
order to work with the language.

## Features

- decodes Scala encodings in stack traces
- disambiguates between objects and types in stack frames
- syntax highlights stack traces
- tabulates stack traces to make them easier to read
- introduces a `Codepoint` contextual value containing the sourcefile and line


## Availability







## Getting Started

### `safely` and `unsafely`

When `language.experimental.saferExceptions` is enabled, any expression which
may throw an exception must be handled with a `try`/`catch`, or the exception
declared in its signature.  Sometimes, we know enough about the execution state
to circumvent this.

If we know that the exception will not be thrown (or we are confident that it
doesn't matter!), then we can wrap the expression in `unsafely`, for example,
invoking a `send()` method which could throw a `SendError`,
```scala
def send(): Response throws SendError = ...
```
can be performed without any error handling with:
```scala
import digression.*
import language.experimental.saferExceptions

val response: Response = unsafely(send())
```

The `unsafely` method works by providing a contextual `CanThrow[Exception]`
instance in its parameter.

The `safely` method can be used in the same way, but will catch thrown
exceptions and convert them to the `Unset` value, effectively changing the
return type from `ReturnType` to `Maybe[ReturnType]`.

This is useful in cases where an exception may be expected, but enough is known
about it to handle it without examining it. An additional use-case is
_fire-and-forgat_ method calls where we care neither about the normal nor an
exceptional result.

### `Codepoint`

A method may request a `Codepoint` value in `using` clause, like so:
```scala
def callMe()(using codepoint: Codepoint): Unit
```

The `codepoint` parameter will contain, _at runtime_, two values which will be
computed _during compilation_ at the callsite: the source file of the callsite,
and the line number of that file.

So, compiling a file called `src/tests.scala` which contains calls to
`callMe()` on lines `138` and `211` will provide the instances,
`Codepoint("src/tests.scala", 138)` and `Codepoint("src/tests.scala", 211)` as
`using` parameters to these invocations.

Subsequent recompilations may, of course, potentially change the line numbers
if the invocations move within the file.

### The `Error` type and `err""` messages

Error messages for exceptions are usually constructed as a single string. For
most purposes, this is sufficient, but by eagerly converting the exception's
parameters to strings, it makes a compromise on the flexibility of the message
at a later time when it may be presented to a user.

A typical exception will include one or more parameters, which capture,
somehow, the conditions in which the exception was thrown. An error message
will present those parameters in context, in a human-readable form, for
(usually) a programmer to decipher. However, converting those parameters to
strings at the point of costruction makes it impossible to inspect them later,
and capturing the parameters in the exception independently of the message
would duplicate them unnecessarily. One particular compromise made is the
inability to distinguish between the parts of the message that are static for
all instances of the exception, and those which vary depending on its state.

The essence of an uncompromising, structured error message would be a `Tuple` of
_n_ parameters, with _n + 1_ fragments of text interleaving it. For example, an
error message about a missing file could be structured,
```scala
case class MissingFile(dir: Directory, child: Text) extends Exception
```
with a message that reads:
```scala
t"The directory $dir did not contain the file $child."
```

By representing this as the tuple, `(dir: Directory, child: Text)` and the
text fragments, `List(t"The directory ", t" did not contain the file ", t".")`,
we would store precisely the state we want, and is provided in
[Rudiments](https://github.com/propensive/rudiments/)' `ErrorMessage` type:
```scala
import rudiments.*
val dir: Directory = ...
val child: Text = ...
val message = ErrorMessage[(Directory, Text)](List(t"The directory ",
    t" did not contain the file ", t"."), (dir, child))
```

Unfortunately, this is a very inconvenient way to write a message.

The `err""` interpolator constructs an instance of `ErrorMessage` without such
convoluted code:
```scala
val message = err"The directory $directory did not contain the file $child."
```

Combining this with Digression's `Error` class, distinct from
`java.lang.Error`, provides a convenient way of defining a new exception type:
```scala
import digression.*
case class MissingFile(dir: Directory, child: Text)
extends Error(err"The directory $directory did not contain the file $child.")
```

### Rewritten stack traces

Digression provides an immutable representation of an exception's stack trace,
called `StackTrace`, constructed from a `Throwable`, but with stack frames
rewritten to make it easier to relate Java's raw method names with the Scala
code which created them.

This includes the following rewrites:
 - symbolic names are decoded
 - class vs object calls are distinguished with `#` or `.`
 - primitives are written with full names
 - package file objects and extenion methods are indicated as such
 - lambdas and anonymous classes are identified
 - `Function` types are written inline

[Escapade](https://github.com/propensive/escapade) provides a contextual
`AnsiShow` instance for `StackTrace`, and by extension, `Exception`.




## Status

Digression is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Soundness projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, can still be used,
as long as caution is taken to avoid a mismatch between the project's stability
level and the required stability and maintainability of your own project.

Digression is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 293 lines of code.

## Building

Digression will ultimately be built by Fury, when it is published. In the
meantime, two possibilities are offered, however they are acknowledged to be
fragile, inadequately tested, and unsuitable for anything more than
experimentation. They are provided only for the necessity of providing _some_
answer to the question, "how can I try Digression?".

1. *Copy the sources into your own project*
   
   Read the `fury` file in the repository root to understand Digression's build
   structure, dependencies and source location; the file format should be short
   and quite intuitive. Copy the sources into a source directory in your own
   project, then repeat (recursively) for each of the dependencies.

   The sources are compiled against the latest nightly release of Scala 3.
   There should be no problem to compile the project together with all of its
   dependencies in a single compilation.

2. *Build with [Wrath](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/)*

   Wrath is a bootstrapping script for building Digression and other projects in
   the absence of a fully-featured build tool. It is designed to read the `fury`
   file in the project directory, and produce a collection of JAR files which can
   be added to a classpath, by compiling the project and all of its dependencies,
   including the Scala compiler itself.
   
   Download the latest version of
   [`wrath`](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/releases/latest), make it
   executable, and add it to your path, for example by copying it to
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   Clone this repository inside an empty directory, so that the build can
   safely make clones of repositories it depends on as _peers_ of `digression`.
   Run `wrath -F` in the repository root. This will download and compile the
   latest version of Scala, as well as all of Digression's dependencies.

   If the build was successful, the compiled JAR files can be found in the
   `.wrath/dist` directory.

## Contributing

Contributors to Digression are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like
to look for issues marked
[beginner](https://github.com/propensive/digression/labels/beginner).

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing
Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of contributing to Digression
easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

A _digression_ is a deviation from the main subject, much like an exception departs from the main path.

In general, Soundness project names are always chosen with some rationale,
however it is usually frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its
_uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or catchiness, and there is no
bias towards names with positive or "nice" meanings—since many of the libraries
perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it
should be noted how willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally
of Greek or Latin origin, and have often arrived in English via a romance
language.
