Stack traces correspond to the classes, interfaces and methods as they exist on
the running JVM. The Scala definitions from which they originate may have
undergone various name changes during compilation, and features of Scala which
do not exist in Java may have been encoded in method and class names, such that
the original Scala names and features are harder to discern. _Digression_
believes that a Scala developer (particularly a beginner, who will still be
exposed to stack traces) should not have to understand how Scala is encoded in
order to work with the language.
